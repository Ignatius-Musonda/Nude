            From day 1 at Nudefeet, we have been reimagining what footwear
            could be, while also reimagining how the lives of the people in our
            community could be elevated by deploying their artisan talents into
            making incredible footwear that would delight people around the
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            And since that 1st day we've never stopped, proudly crafting
            footwear that blends artisan-crafted & upcycled materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result: the worldâ€™s finest handmade runners that let us all
            walk, run, train & LIVE. SOLEFULLY.
